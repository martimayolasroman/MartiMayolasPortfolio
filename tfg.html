                        <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>

                        <p> This Project focuses on <b>analyzing mobile applications in the health sector</b>,
                             specifically <b>examining their user interface design, usability, and user experience</b>. 
                             A comprehensive evaluation was conducted on various health-related mobile applications using a<b> Likert scale-based checklist. </b>
                             The <b>applications were classified into different categories, and a web page, "Biblioteca mSalut,"</b> was developed to facilitate 
                             easy access and consultation of these applications.
                            The <b>results </b>highlight that while <b>many applications perform well in terms of compatibility, navigation, and design,
                             there are significant areas for improvement in personalization and accessibility.</b> The project also identified common design patterns
                              and differences across applications, providing valuable insights for future development. <b>The findings underscore the importance of user-centered design
                               in increasing the adoption and effectiveness of mHealth applications.</b>
                        </p>
                          
                            

                            <h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>

                            <p> <b>Analyze the usability, user interface and user experience of different mobile applications in the field of health:</b>
                                Collect different mobile applications in the field of health and analyze the usability, user interface and user experience 
                                through a checklist scored with the Likert scale.<br>
                                <b>Evaluating the user interface in mobile applications in the field of health:</b>
                                Conduct critical user interface evaluations of a variety of healthcare mobile applications to identify common patterns and design differences.<br>
                                <b> Develop a library of health mobile applications classified as:</b>
                                Create a library of mobile applications in the field of health classified by different types such as: 
                                diegetic UI, 3D, 2D elements, serious games, specific diseases...<br>
                           </p>

                            <p>Each of these sections will be scored using the Likert scale. The Likert scale is a psychometric scale 
                                commonly used in social science research that employs questionnaires. It is the most commonly used approach 
                                to gradient ordering responses to survey research, the Likert scale format is 5-level, typically: 1. Strongly Disagree, 2. Disagree, 3. 
                                Neither neither agree nor disagree, 4. Agree, 5. Totally agree
                            </p>
