                        <p>This project consisted of developing a UI concept for a match-3 game called Space Match. 
                            The goal was to create an attractive, intuitive and functional interface for mobile devices, while keeping the gameplay fast and fun.

                            I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create the visual elements of the game, such as buttons, icons, and loading screens. 
                            I also used After Effects to animate menu interactions and transition effects, creating a smoother and more engaging experience for the player.

                            <h4>THE IRREGULAR - UE4 3D Video Game</h4>
                            <p>The Irregular is a fast-paced magic FPS where players must use their magical abilities to reclaim their lands.
                                 Throughout the game, players can learn new spells, explore magical lands, face powerful bosses, and solve puzzles to advance the story. </p>
                            <p>The UI design focused on creating a visual experience that was consistent with the game's magical world, while maintaining intuitive usability.
                                 The interface needed to be clear and accessible so that players could manage their magical 
                                abilities and stats in the midst of the action without distractions. My goal was to design a UI that offered crucial information without hindering immersion and fast gameplay. </p>
                            <p>As a UI/UX Designer, I was responsible for the creation and implementation of the following elements: </p>
                            <p><b>Main Menu and Pause Menu:</b> I designed a clear and functional interface that allows the player to navigate through the game options efficiently. <br>
                                <b> Player HUD:</b> I implemented the HUD (Heads-Up Display) elements, displaying the player's magic skills, health, and stats in a minimalist and clear way.<br>
                                    <b>Tutorial UI Elements:</b> I designed the interactive components that guide players through the game mechanics, ensuring that new players can quickly learn the skills and controls. </p>

                                <p>One of the main challenges was integrating the necessary amount of information into the UI without overwhelming the player or distracting them from the fast and frenetic combat.
                                     I managed to solve this by designing a clean and modular HUD, prioritizing the most crucial elements (such as health and active skills). </p>

                            <h4>GO ON - HYPERCASUAL ANDROID GAME - UNITY 2D</h4>
                            <p>GoOn is a 2D hypercasual game for Android that challenges players to advance through obstacle-filled levels while using 
                                their skills and reflexes. The player must avoid obstacles and traps that vary in difficulty as they progress through the different levels, making use of simple but precise controls.

                             <p>As a <b>UI/UX Designer</b>, my responsibilities included:

                             <p>Designing and implementing the main menu and pause menu.<br>

                             <p>One of the biggest challenges was designing levels that were accessible to casual players, but challenging enough to keep them engaged. I achieved this by adjusting 
                                the progressive difficulty of the levels and adding engaging visual elements, such as particle effects and post-processing, that enhanced immersion without distracting the player.

                            <h4>RETRO DRIFT - UNITY 2D </h4>
                            <p>"Retro Drift is an action video game in which players must defeat and dodge enemies by drifting their car. 
                                The goal is to upgrade the car in the shop to make it more powerful and face increasingly difficult enemies.
                                 This game was developed in just six days as part of the 'Juice Jam 2' event, where I was responsible for the entire development process.
                                <br>
                                The core of the game revolves around drifting. Players control a car that can dodge and defeat enemies through precise drifting maneuvers. As they progress, they can access a shop to upgrade the vehicle, adding more power and stamina, allowing them to take on stronger enemies.
                                <br><br>
                                During the development of Retro Drift, I took on all roles, including:<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Gameplay Design:</b> I implemented the drifting mechanics and car upgrades, fine-tuning the balance between difficulty and fun.<br>
                                <b>Art and Graphics: </b>I created the retro visuals, using a vibrant color palette and minimalist visual effects.<br>
                                <b>Programming:</b> I developed all of the game's code, implementing both the combat mechanics and the upgrade systems in the shop.<br><br>
                                One of the biggest challenges was the limited time. I had to prioritize the most important features and maintain simplicity in the design, while ensuring that the game was entertaining and offered meaningful progression for the player. I opted for a minimalist retro graphical style that allowed me to keep the aesthetics appealing without spending too much time on complex details.
                                
                                I developed Retro Drift using Unity as the main engine. For the graphics, I used Photoshop and a pixel-art style to give the game its signature 
                                retro aesthetic. Additionally, I implemented the visual and particle effects directly in Unity to create a dynamic gameplay experience."</p>

                            <h4>SCALE THE BUBBLE - UNITY 2D - GMTK 2024 JAM</h4>
                            <p>Scale the Bubble is a simple yet challenging game, where players must control a bubble as it moves through obstacles. The key is to change the size of 
                                the bubble to get around the obstacles, but be careful: if it is too big or too small, the bubble will burst! The goal is to advance as far as possible
                                 while handling the controls with precision.</p>
                            
                            <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing the difficulty of the level so that players could learn the game mechanics naturally, but without making the 
                                game too easy or too hard. To solve this, I adjusted the bubble physics and created a progressive difficulty curve. I also tested with different players 
                                to optimize the controls and make sure they were intuitive.</p>
